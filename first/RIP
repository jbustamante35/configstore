Here lies .first Commit, my first ever commit of dotfiles.

This grave marks the day I finally decided to remove you from the main
ConfigStore repository. An anonymous user wrote a bit of prose in honor of
our fallen dotfile directory:

A Prelude to .first Commit

You barely had anything in you; just some simple aliases and functions in a
simple bashrc.  We knew not of zsh, vimrc, i3wm, dunst, conky,
compton.  Nor did we follow @LukeSmith, @DistroTube, r/unixporn.

It was a simpler time, where merge conflicts and git problems were few and
far between.  Though we've grown older, wiser, and more sophisticated with
our configurations, we must never forget where we first started. And that was
with you, ye ol' .first commit.

May you forever rest in peace.
