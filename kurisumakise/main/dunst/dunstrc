    ### Personalized Notifications ###
    # Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
    # override settings for certain messages.
    # Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "category",
# "msg_urgency" and you can override the "timeout", "urgency", "foreground",
# "background", "new_icon" and "format".
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by # setting the
# "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order to find
# fitting options for rules.

#[script-test]
#    summary = "*script*"
#    script = dunst_test.sh

#[ignore]
#    # This notification will not be displayed
#    summary = "foobar"
