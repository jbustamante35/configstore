# Dots-RinTohsaka
Repository to store all of my dotfiles from RinTohsaka. This "home base" is
maintained by the dotify ruby module, which basically moved every dotfile in
my home folder to the single ~/.dotify directory and replaced the original
dotfile with a softlink pointing to its corresponding location in ~.dotrc.

I really don't like the idea of having the raw location of my dotfiles in a
single directory, so I set up this github repo to backup these configuration
files in case anything goes wrong.
