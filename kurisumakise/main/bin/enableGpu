# Taken from forum answer to get nvidia driver with bumblebee working
# See reply from Graff:
# https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=238389
#
# Usage:
# ## Final remarks
# 1. Reboot and verify that nvidia is not loaded ```lsmod | grep nvidia```
# 2. Disconnect charger and verify on *powertop* that power consumption is ~4W
#       on idle (Dell XPS 4k, undervolt -168mV core / -145mV cache, disabled
#       touchscreen, powertop --auto-tune)
# 3. Enable GPU by using script.
# 4. Verify if GPU is loaded by using ```nvidia-smi```
# 5. Run unigine-valley ```optirun unigine-valley```
# 6. Close all nvidia applications and disable gpu.
# 7. Check again power consumption, it should have similar value as before.

# Allow to load nvidia module
mv /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nvidia.conf /etc/modprobe.d/disable-nvidia.conf.disable

# remove NVIDIA card (currently in power/control = auto)
echo -n 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/remove
sleep 1
# change PCIe power control
echo -n on > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/power/control
sleep 1
# rescan for NVIDIA card (defaults to power/control = on)
echo -n 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan

## Additional comment from this site:
# I tried solution above and it worked but I had to add one more step: I had to
# ran `modprobe nvidia` after executing enableGpu.sh . Another user had same
# effect by running `nvidia-smi` (which also loads nvidia module). So if you
# get `Cannot access secondary GPU` or any similar error with this method,
# try adding `modprobe nvidia` to last line of the enableGpu.sh script. Be
# careful when testing though, in my case, `unigine-valley` did not teminate
# properly so I could not unload nvidia module. I had to manually kill `
# valley_x64` process to unload it.

# modprobe nvidia;
