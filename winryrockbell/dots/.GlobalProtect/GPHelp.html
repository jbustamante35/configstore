You can use the GlobalProtect agent to connect to your corporate network and access your company’s internal resources from anywhere in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="connect">Connect to the GlobalProtect VPN</a></h2>
<p>
In most circumstances, the GlobalProtect agent will run transparently in the background, protecting you from network threats. Depending on how your administrator has configured GlobalProtect, you may automatically be connected to the VPN as soon as you log in to your computer or device. If you find you are not connected, you can manually connect as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Connect</b> or <b>Enable</b>—Select this option to connect to GlobalProtect. The agent will automatically select which gateway to connect to, depending on the configuration the administrator defined and the response times of the available gateways.</li>
<li><b>Connect to</b>—Select a specific gateway from the menu or select <b>Auto Discovery</b> to enable the agent to determine the best gateway to connect to.</li></ul>
<p>If prompted, enter your <b>User Name</b> and <b>Password</b> and click <b>Apply</b>. As soon as the agent successfully connects, the GlobalProtect icon changes to a globe with a shield. When you hover over the icon it shows the status <b>Connected</b>.</p>
